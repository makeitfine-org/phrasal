 ### Notes 

Prompt which created 2 pane 
 1) Create new `tmux new-session -s claude-team` session
 2) Create and run a team with 2 agent to refactor the frontend and backend.                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Use agents: @"backend-naming-reviewer (agent)" @"frontend-naming-reviewer (agent)"
 (but all time it was idled)

1) Create new `tmux new-session -s claude` session
2) Create and run a team with 1 agent to refactor frontend.                                                                                                                               
   Use agents: @"frontend-naming-reviewer (agent)"
   (but all time it was idled, not responded)

1.
- /loop 5m check if the deploy finished
- /loop 5m "Execute [Task A], [Task B], and [Task C]. Keep track of how many times you have done this in this session. Once you have completed all three tasks for the 3rd time, run the command /loop --cancel to stop this recurring task."
- /loop 1h "/review-pr 1234"
- /loop "run tests" --every 1h --for 1d
- /loop --cancel [ID]


2. Parallel Sessions (Native Worktrees)
   This is the most efficient way to keep each task in its own isolated branch and file context.
   
   Terminal 1: claude -w task-1
   Terminal 2: claude -w task-2
   Terminal 3: claude -w task-3
   
   Using the --worktree (or -w) flag automatically creates a new branch and a isolated directory in .claude/worktrees/, ensuring the agents don't overwrite each other's


3. Run agent team:
   // settings.json  
   { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
   
   "teammateMode": "tmux" in settings.local.json

    In prompt say to create agent with TeamCreate tools (see prompts below)

4. 
   ```
   I'd like to create a feature description for backlog.md.
   Help me to create description by interactivly interviewing me.
   And evenually output me on the screen the description.

   This is draft of the feature description:
   I want to implement a User registration by username and password for my application.
   It should use keycloak up and running locally with docker for handling these.
   After registration, can login to application.
   Also User should have a posibility to edit it's name.
   User should have uqiue name which allows only symbols:[a-zA-Z0-9_] and name not less then 5 symbols not more then 15.
   User can add it's avatar picture (png or jpg).
   User password should be strong, not less then 8 symbols and defined by security rules you propose.
   ```
   ```
   save this as a backlog task via the Backlog MCP
   ```
   ```    
   Use the backlog mcp to decompose this `Task-6` into smaller subtasks. 
   Each task must have clear 'Acceptance Criteria' in its description.
   ```
   ```
   I want to implement a [Feature Name, e.g., REST API for User Profiles]. 
   Based on our Java project structure, use the backlog tool to decompose this 
   into 10-15 small, atomic tasks. Each task must have clear 'Acceptance Criteria'  
   in its description.
   ```   
   ```
   I need to add a new feature.
   We need to implement a JWT authentication filter for our Spring Security setup.
   Create a task for this in the backlog.
   ```
   ```
   Create a task for 'Database Migration' and include three subtasks as a checklist:
   1. Create SQL script, 2. Update Entity classes, 3. Run migration test.
   ```
   ```
   Create a parent task called 'API Security' and 4 subtasks as individual 
   backlog items. Link them together.
   ```
   ```
   When run `make clean build` it is failed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
   Create a task in the backlog to solve the described problem.
   ```
   ```
   Read backlog task TASK-6.1 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress, implement it.
   ```   
   ```
   Complete the backlog task-
   ```
   ```
   /loop "Check the backlog for the next 'TODO' task. Start it, implement the Java code, run tests to verify, and mark it as 'DONE'. Continue until all tasks for this feature are complete."
   ```
   ```   
   Read backlog task TASK-6.10 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress, implement it.                                                                                     
   When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock make clean build.                                                                                                                                                                                   
   When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   ```
   ```
   From backlog.md read sequentially and complete sequentially task-6.4, task-6.5.

   For each task:
   1. Move it to `In Progress`
   2. When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock `make clean build`
   3. When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   4. Do not move to the next task until the current one is fully complete, validation is successful and changes commited.
   
   Start with task-6.4.
   ```
   ```
   You are test-automator which is implementing TASK-6.12:                                                                                                                                                                                                               
   Read backlog task TASK-6.12 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress (if it wasn't done), check what was done in scope of the task, and then complete its implementation.                                                                                                                                                                     
   When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock `make clean build`.
   When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   ```
   ```   
   Create an agent team.
   Spawn three agents in parallel. Load the TeamCreate tool schema and spawn the agent team
   
   Agent 1 — test-automator — implement TASK-6.11:                                                                                                                                                                                                               
   Read backlog task TASK-6.11 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress, implement it.                                                                                                                                                                     
   When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock make clean build
   When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   
   Agent 2 — test-automator — implement TASK-6.12:                                                                                                                                                                                                               
   Read backlog task TASK-6.12 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress, implement it.                                                                                                                                                                     
   When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock make clean build
   When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   
   Agent 3 — test-automator — implement TASK-6.13:                                                                                                                                                                                                               
   Read backlog task TASK-6.13 via the backlog MCP, move it to In Progress, implement it.                                                                                                                                                                     
   When ready to validate, run: flock /tmp/make-build.lock make clean build
   When validation is successful commit changes, include also this task description Markdown file into commit.
   
   NOTE: flock serializes make build — if two agents finish at the same time,                                                                                                                                                                                  
   the second waits for the first to complete before running. This avoids docker compose collisions.
   ```
   
5. 
   ```
   Which tasks can be run in parallel by different agents?
   ```

6. Any issues with the team:
   $> ps aux | grep 'claude.*--agent-id'
   $> pgrep -la claude
   $> kill the processes

7. Think about to include "/loop 15m run /compact command to reduce context"

8. rebuild and re-run single component:
   ● # 1) Rebuild the backend JAR                                     
   cd /home/eug/dev/projects/my/claude-ai-spring-boot/backend && mvn clean package -DskipTests
   # 2) Build new Docker image (replaces the old one in-place)
   docker build -t claude-ai-spring-boot-backend:latest .
   # 3) Replace only the backend container
   docker compose -f /home/eug/dev/projects/my/claude-ai-spring-boot/docker-compose.yml up -d --no-deps backend
   What each step does:
   - `mvn clean package -DskipTests` — fast rebuild; drop -DskipTests if you want tests to run
   - `docker build -t claude-ai-spring-boot-backend:latest .` — overwrites the existing image tag in place
   - `up -d --no-deps app` — recreates only the backend container using the new image; --no-deps prevents docker compose from touching postgres, keycloak, frontend, etc.

   docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.CreatedAt}}"

9. Release:
   Analyze and show me new relase tag with description and step how to create it.
